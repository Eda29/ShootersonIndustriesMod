        "description": "essentially +P+ .460 Rowland, .460 Siberian Express is an extremely powerful cartridge that packs the power of an intermediate rifle cartridge moreso than a pistol. Loaded with a 207 gr ballistic tip jacketed hollowpoint bullet, this round is meant to devastate soft targets and flesh. Despite this, the sheer amount of Oomph behind the round makes it punch through some softer armour. Though dimensionally identical to regular .460 Rowland, its much MUCH higher pressures mean that you don't feel safe firing it out of a regular .460 gun, let alone a plain old .45 ACP one.",
